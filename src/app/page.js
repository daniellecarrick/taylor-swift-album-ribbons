          Timbre is the quality of a musical note or sound that distinguishes
          different types of musical instruments, or voices. It is a complex
          notion also referred to as sound color, texture, or tone quality, and is
          derived from the shape of a segment’s spectro-temporal surface,
          independently of pitch and loudness. We converted those features into a
          color to see if "Red" really is, well, Red. (Spoiler: It's more of a
